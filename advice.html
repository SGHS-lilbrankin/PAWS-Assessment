<h1> ANIMAL CARE: </h1>

<h2>Deciding to have a pet in your life is a big commitment in which you need to understand the responsibilities about. Pets quality of life in very dependant on the owner. You must look after and care for you pet and ensure they have food, water, shelter, living area and vet check ups to ensure your companion has a happy and healthy life. Before deciding to adopt a pet from us here at the shelter, you need to prove to us that the animal is going to a home where it will be loved and is perfectly adequate for their needs.</h2>

<h3><u>DOGS</u><h3>
<h2>Young dogs - Puppies - need regular feeds depending on their age. Dry food such as biscuits or nuts provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs. Clean, fresh water needs to be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently. Dogs also need regular exercise to stay healthy.</h2>

<h3><u>CATS</u><h3>
<h2>Most cats stay quite clean but should be brushed/combed regularly. All indoor cats must have a litter box and should also have a scratching post and have its nails cut every few weeks. Their diet must consist of taurine which is an essential amino acid needed for heart and eye health and should always have access to fresh water. When you adopt a cat, it comes spayed/neutered.</h2>

<h3><u>RABBITS</u></h3>
<h2>Rabbits require time and attention and needed to be checked on a daily basis. If outside they should live in a hutch preferably with a run so they can exercise to stay healthy. A sleeping sheltered area is also necessary. They prefer to be with another rabbit for company too but must not be put in a hatch with a guinea pig as they communicate differently and could end up injured. If they are living inside ensure that cables have a protective cover and any poisonous plants are removed. They typically eat hay, grass and vegetables. A small about of high fibre pellets may be used if desired. Fresh water must always be accessible too.</h2>

<h3><u>LAMBS</u></h3>
<h2>They must have a clean, warm shelter for survival such as straw. A lamb's main source of food is milk so will need to be fed by a bottle. At around 3 weeks, muesli/grain mix is good to help build up the lambs and they can slowly be weaned off the milk and onto grass and muesli once they start eating it. A clean water source must be available too.</h2>

<h3><u>PIGS</u></h3>
<h2>Pigs require a supply of fresh water at all times and their bowls should be cleaned regularly. There diet could consists of milk, grass, grains, vegetables. They should have a secure but spacious area to roam if not kept in a sty and will have a ring in their nose when you adopt them to prevent any digging.</h2>
