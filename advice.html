<h1> ANIMAL CARE: </h1>

<p>Choosing to have a pet in your life is a lifelong commitment. Most pets are wholly dependent on their owners for their quality of life. It is important to ensure you can properly care for your pet and understand your pet's needs.

Animals don't just need food and water, they need appropriate shelter and living space, regular vet check-ups and preventative vet care to ensure they remain happy and healthy. Just as importantly, your pet needs you: your time, love and attention. Many pets need mental stimulation and regular exercise to prevent them from becoming bored or overweight.</p>

<h4><u>Lambs</u></h4>
<p>Provide a clean, warm and well-bedded shelter for the lamb or group of lambs of similar ages. A lamb's primary source of nutrition is milk, and hand-raised lambs must be fed milk from a bottle. Depending on the size of your sheep herd, it may save time to feed older lambs using a pail or automated livestock feeder. </p>

<h4><u>Dogs</u></h4>
<p>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.
Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.
Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.
When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.
For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.
Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.

Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). Please limit "people food," however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.<p>
